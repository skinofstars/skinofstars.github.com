![What are those markings?](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5842/2554/400/f2.jpg)

I was reminded of a blog called Boing Boing by the Flying Doctor today. This lead me on a merry maze through the internet till I came across a very bizarre post that I thought I'd share:

[SWAPATORIUM: Faces](http://swapatorium.blogspot.com/2006/06/faces.html)

The point raised in the post was that this fella acquired slides of these girls, many of them with numbers written on their foreheads. He posted the picture in the hope that someone would solve the mystery.

I'm not convinced by some of the suggestions for the reason of this, but it's interesting to wonder. The set of pictures themselves are a little on the weird side.
