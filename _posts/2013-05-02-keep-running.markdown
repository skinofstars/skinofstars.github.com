excerpt: Over the past couple of years I've really gotten myself in to running. Last year I seemed to have peaked on my season's running, I think I did about 10 events. I hit most of my targets, with a 47:20 10km and a 1:51:45 half-marathon. I was really pleased with these, but they were all building up to the big one. The Marathon. I ended up doing the Milton Keynes event last April in 4:25:32. I'll admit, I was somewhat disappointed with my time as I was sure I could have done it in under 4hrs, but I know why I didn't.

This year has been a little less serious. I did the Oxford Town &amp; Gown 10k, which is a great event if you ever get the chance, but that's about it. I may do more, but I'm not thrashing myself. Last year I pushed very hard to get Marathon ready and it kinda took the fun out of it (especially with my result disappointment). I'm more keen to just enjoy running now rather than chasing times.

One thing I do recommend is to go running with people. A gang of us at work go out a few times a week and it's both a good motivator and a great way to wind down with the team. Plus, a little friendly rivalry never goes amiss ;)
