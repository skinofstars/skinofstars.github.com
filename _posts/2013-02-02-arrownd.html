excerpt: One of our designers has a love for putting variable size arrows on navigation lists. This is really easy to do in Photoshop but a damn nightmare to build. However, I felt bad that saying it was something we couldn't really do. I mean, coming up with solutions is our thing right?! So I spent some time thinking about it...

One of our designers has a love for putting variable size arrows on navigation lists. This is really easy to do in Photoshop but a damn nightmare to build. However, I felt bad that saying it was something we couldn't really do. I mean, coming up with solutions is our thing right?! So I made a jQuery plugin called <a href="https://github.com/skinofstars/arrownd">Arrownd</a>.
</p>

<style><!--
        ul.arrownd-example {
width: 150px;
}
ul.arrownd-example li {
list-style-type: none;
line-height: 1.5em;
margin-bottom: 5px;
}
--></style>
<ul class="arrownd-example">
    <li>item</li>
    <li>multi line
item</li>
    <li>item</li>
</ul>

The options are as follows

<pre>
options = {
    'position'    : 'top', // top, bottom, left, right
    'arrowDepth'  : 10,
    'radius'      : 5,
    'lineWidth'   : 1,
    'lineColour'  : '', // hex value
    'fillColour'  : '#5CB78E'
}
</pre>

<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/jquery.arrownd.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[
$(document).ready(function(){         $('.arrownd-example li').arrownd({
            'position':'right',
            'arrowDepth':10,
            'radius':5,
'fillColour'  : '#5CB78E'
        });      });
// ]]></script>
