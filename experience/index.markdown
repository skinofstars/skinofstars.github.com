Hello, my name is Kevin and I've been working as a web developer full time since 2010. 

I'm one of those guys that loves this stuff. I develop sites through the day, I run geek events in the evenings and weekends, and I go home and relax by playing with new tech. 

I've run several hack days, including ones for (http://www.rhok.org)[Random Hacks of Kindness] and the (http://opendataday.org)[Open Data Day]. I'm also a co-founder of (http://jsoxford.com)[JS Oxford].

Of course, I did this as hobby before I even dreamed of it as a job. I was making sites for various community groups, running blogs and forums since as far back as 2001. I decided that I loved my hobby so much that I wanted to do it as a career, so I went to Brookes University where I got a 1st class BSc in Media Communications and Multimedia Systems. 

My current stack speciality is Debian/Ubuntu Linux with either Symfony (PHP MVC framework) or Node.js. Though I have spent time playing with Backbone.js and AngularJS, my favourite JS framework at the moment is KnockoutJS.

I would find I very hard to list all the technologies I've had experience with, so here are what I've had most experience with so far:

Languages

* PHP
* JavaScript
* HTML / CSS
* Ruby
* Python
* XSLT
* Bash

Frameworks

* Symfony
* Silex
* Wordpress
* Mediawiki
* Phonegap / Cordova
* KnockoutJS
* Ruby on Rails

Databases

* MySQL
* CouchDB
* SQLite
* Various browser/mobile databases

Devops

* Linux sysadmin
* TDD/BDD, mostly with phpunit/behat
* Capistrano/Capifony
* Continuous deployment
* Node.js

Of course, this list really is a greatest hits type thing. It's almost inevitable when playing with a platform that you'll have to tweak some YAML, scan through some C to see how a lib works, or just try a new framework for fun.

Most of my time I have been working in an Agile development environment, where tasking up sprints, working through burndowns and holding retrospectives is de rigeur. My favourite aspect of this is the daily stand-up meeting, which I find invaluable for information sharing in a small team. It sets you up for the day, to reflect on what's happened and what you're going to do.

I've also been fortunate enough to be acting lead developer on several large scale projects, handling work distribution in teams of 3-4 developers, liaising with other team leaders and defining the project's overall architecture.

I spent 2010 to 2013 at one of the UK's leading web development agencies, where I have been lucky enough to work on some huge projects for some fantastic clients. However, I decided it was time to move on, starting with 4 months travelling around South East Asia and New Zealand to make sure I wasn't only thinking within the tech bubble.

Now I'm looking for some great projects to work on and interesting people work with. If you've got something in mind that you think I could help you with, then please get in contact and let me know about yourself and your work.
